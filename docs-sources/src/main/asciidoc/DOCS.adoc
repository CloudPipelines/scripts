= Cloud Pipelines scripts

_Documentation Authors: Marcin Grzejszczak, Cora Iberkleid_

This project tries to solve the following problems:

- Creation of a common deployment pipeline
- Propagation of good testing & deployment practices
- Speed up the time required to deploy a feature to production

A common way of running, configuring and deploying applications lowers support costs
and time needed by new developers to blend in when they change projects.
